# Improv-Suggestion-App
An improv suggestion generator for Blue Door Theatre made with vanilla javascript for use with improv shows, practices and classes.

I learned to work with end users, DOM manipulation, regex and best practices
My biggest challenges were visual design and achieving a 100% Lighthouse score
